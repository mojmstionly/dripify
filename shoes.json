"description":"The Air Jordan 1 Low GS 'Black Toe' brings the OG colorway to grade-school sizes. Released in April 2019, the shoe stays largely true to the original, with a white leather upper accented by Gym Red on the collar and heel, complemented by black nubuck on the eyestay, toe box and Swoosh. Tonal 'Wings' branding emerges on the heel, while underfoot, a white Air midsole gives way to a Gym Red outsole with a concenctric traction pattern."
