The shoe which ties into the shoe's mythic 'Banned' narrative, features a leather upper finished in two-tone color blocking similar to the OG 'Shadow' colorway. Details include the 'Banned' AJ1's red 'X' on the heel, along with an all-over print that spells out 'They Can't You From Wearing Them,' which paraphrases a line from an original Air Jordan 1 TV commercial from 1985.", "Saleprice": "7,490"}
